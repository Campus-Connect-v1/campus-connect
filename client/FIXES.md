# React Native Reanimated & Expo Router Fixes

## Issues Resolved

This PR fixes the following issues that were preventing the app from running:

1. ✅ **React Native Reanimated initialization error** - "Exception in HostFunction"
2. ✅ **Expo Router warning** - "Route missing the required default export"
3. ✅ **SafeAreaView deprecation warning** (already using correct import)

## Root Cause

The application had **"use client" directives** in multiple files. This directive is:
- ✅ **Valid** for Next.js with React Server Components
- ❌ **Invalid** for React Native / Expo applications

This caused the Metro bundler to fail parsing files, leading to module loading errors.

## Changes Made

### Removed "use client" from 17 files:
- All tab routes: `app/(tabs)/*.tsx`
- All auth routes: `app/auth/*.tsx`
- Messaging routes: `app/messaging/*.tsx`
- User profile routes: `app/(users)/*.tsx`
- UI components: `src/components/ui/*.tsx`
- Custom hooks: `src/hooks/*.tsx`

### Cleaned up home.tsx:
- Removed 310 lines of commented-out dead code
- Removed invalid "use client" directive
- File now properly structured for Expo Router

### Verified Configuration:
- ✅ `babel.config.js` - react-native-reanimated/plugin is last (required)
- ✅ All SafeAreaView imports use `react-native-safe-area-context`
- ✅ All route files have proper default exports

## How to Run

```bash
# Navigate to client directory
cd client

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Clear Metro cache and start fresh
npx expo start --clear

# Or start normally
npm start
```

### If Issues Persist

```bash
# Clean rebuild (for native module issues)
npx expo prebuild --clean
npx expo start
```

## Expected Behavior

After these fixes:
- ✅ No "use client" directive warnings
- ✅ No "missing default export" warnings  
- ✅ React Native Reanimated initializes properly
- ✅ App loads without module errors
- ✅ All routes render correctly

## Technical Details

### Versions
- Expo SDK: 54.0.7
- React Native: 0.81.4
- React Native Reanimated: 3.17.5
- React Native Safe Area Context: 5.4.0

### Babel Configuration
The `react-native-reanimated/plugin` **must be the last plugin** in `babel.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: [
      ["babel-preset-expo", { jsxImportSource: "nativewind" }], 
      "nativewind/babel"
    ],
    plugins: [
      "react-native-reanimated/plugin"  // ⚠️ Must be last!
    ],
  };
};
```

## Notes

- Some TypeScript warnings remain (unused variables) but these are non-blocking
- Pre-existing TypeScript type errors in other components were not addressed as they're outside the scope of this fix
- The fixes are minimal and surgical - only removing invalid directives and dead code

## Questions?

If you encounter any issues after applying these fixes:
1. Ensure you cleared Metro cache: `npx expo start --clear`
2. Check that node_modules is up to date: `npm install`
3. Try a clean rebuild: `npx expo prebuild --clean`
